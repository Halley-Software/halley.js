# Halley.JS ☄️
# The small, fast and easy web framework.

## The first version of Halley.js only support get requests, and have the Node native request and response objects.

In addition Halley.js provide a built-in utility for colour text, useful when you print a message when the server is ready, for example:
```ts
halley.ready(halleyColors.print("cyan"))
```
Where the port number could be coloured of cyan, the unique color available for now

> For more info, I recommend you see the README.md, here, in GitHub, see the [npm Halley.js registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/halley.http) or when the official website be available

#### Ups I almost forgot say you that, the original name of halley.http is **halley.js**, but already exist a package with this name on the npm registry and its abandoned.
